Requirement 2 (R2)


Group 1:

The sequence of routers is inconsistent, with the last two routers
    Given this, if a router is busy with other tasks, it will not respond as fast as other routers
    that may have less to do. Thus, this can adversely affect the sequence of routers, as some may respond
    earlier than others.


 - determine the number of probes per “ttl” used in each trace file,
 - determine whether or not the sequence of intermediate routers is the same in different trace
   files,
 - if the sequence of intermediate routers is different in the five trace files, list the difference and
   explain why,
 - if the sequence of intermediate routers is the same in the five trace files, draw a table as shown
   below (warning: the values in the table do not correspond to any trace files) to compare
   the RRTs of different traceroute attempts. From the result, which hop is likely to incur the
   maximum delay? Explain your conclusion

Group 2 has the proper order.

On the other hand, Group 1 does not have the same sequence of routers.
By examining the probes per ttl for group one, there were differences found in the number of probes/ttl
