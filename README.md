trace_route_program

Python program that takes pcapng files as input and uses them to trace network activity. 



Ensure that ALL files are of pcapng format. Pcap is not supported in this implementation.


To convert pcap files to pcapng, simply open the pcap file in Wireshark
and save the file as a pcapng file.
